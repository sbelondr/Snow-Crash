There are two files in /home.
	- level08, a binary executable
	- token, a text file


The binary takes a file in argument, and reads its content. The flag is in token,
	but we do not have the right to read it.
The binary as its sticky bit set, but still refuses to read the token.

We try to create a symbolic link 
ln -sb ~/token /tmp/t

And then:
./level08 /tmp/t
