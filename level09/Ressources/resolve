a la racine il y a deux fichiers un qui permet de chiffrer ce qu on lui donne et un autre contenant la donnee chiffre
In the /home, there are two files:
	- A binary that encrypt its argument
	- A text file with encrypted text

With these two tests:
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 "coucou"
cpwfsz
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 "salut"
sbnxx

We can start guessing the encryption chosen.
We do a program	to gather more information about the encryption. We compute the difference between the two strings. We get that this is just a standard Cesar box cipher.

With this knowledge, we write a program to decrypt the text file, and we get:
